Need to create scraper that will check around 12k pages by changing ID in url. Similar to this site.com/page/1, site.com/page/2 etc.

Website isn't protected with any bot protection. You will need scrape the page and save data to 3 tables in mysql. It has information about github repositories, so you will save repository info and it's ranking.

You will be provided with created mysql DB and repository. Each time when script is starting it should check if current record exists in DB, if it exists - update it, if it doesn't exist - create record. Details about matching page data with fields in DB will be provided to selected candidate.
