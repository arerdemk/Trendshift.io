1- GET TEXT IN SAME CLASS DIFFERENT REFERENCES
  Every web-page has different dynamic and sequntial things. Somehow, if there are a lot of text in same class, 
you can identify just simple bracket like grab element in list. (for get second element in list; [1] (beginning with 0)

2- APPEND VALUE IF NOT EXIST
  In this project some repositories has not some category, you can deternmine just basic if statements. If statement helps to, 
if scrapping element is avaliable get in code, else dosomething(). For in this case, we decided to "NoInfo" value.

3- CLASS IF NOT EXIST
  Sometimes automation tool coming from cons like no algorithm accuracy each other. 
Sometimes count of class is different number and it returns "No Class" error. For handle it, i create if statement in terms of length of class list.
For example if lenght of class below to 2 write "NoInfo" value.
